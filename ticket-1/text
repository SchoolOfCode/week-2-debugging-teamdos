Plan

You and your team have been tasked with debugging a new shopping list application (in the `ticket-1` folder). Despite the CSS and JavaScript files, two issues exist:

- Page is unstyled - the "Add" button should be green.
- Page is not interactive - clicking "Add" does nothing, even though JavaScript handles interactivity.

Your task is to investigate and fix the bugs so:

- Page styling works properly.
- Page becomes fully interactive (adding items to list works).

1. Use devtools to check for error message. No error message in console for css.
2. CSS error: check the link between css and html - there was no link, we created a link
              check the css code for typos/structural issues, check the logic/how the css code is written and works.
3. Look at the js link on html. Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND scripts.js:1
