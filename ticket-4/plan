The code within `ticket-4/index.js` is meant to return a grade based on the value of `points` (as per the table below), but currently it doesn't. You and your team should fix the code so that the function returns the correct grade.

| Function call           | Expected output |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| getGradeFromPoints(100) | "A"             |
| getGradeFromPoints(90)  | "A"             |
| getGradeFromPoints(70)  | "B"             |
| getGradeFromPoints(50)  | "C"             |
| getGradeFromPoints(40)  | "D"             |
| getGradeFromPoints(39)  | "E"             |
| getGradeFromPoints(0)   | "E"             |

Running the file should also log the following to the console:

> A should be A

PLAN: 

1. Check the syntax/structure of code (no typos) -- fixed problems, errors were mostly syntax errors
2. Test the function and check output in devtools
3. Follow the code per line and articulate what is happening explicitly to understand how the function works
    - eg. check data types, return statements, if statement logic
